		<h3>How you can benefit from Mercurial</h3>
		<ol>
		<!-- The three sections should now grow more compact as you go down, with power and speed the longest and just works only two simple, clean sentences. -->
			<li class="i-1">
				<h4>It is <a href="{% url about %}">fast and powerful</a></h4>
				<p>Mercurial offers you the power and speed to efficiently handle <a href="./who_uses_mercurial">projects of any size and kind</a>. Every clone contains the whole project history, so committing, branching, tagging and merging are local operations which makes them fast and convenient. You can use a multitude of <a href="./workflows">workflows</a> and easily enhance its functionality with <a href="./extensions">extensions</a>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="i-2">
				<h4>It is <a href="./learn_mercurial">easy to learn</a></h4>
				<p>You can follow our simple <a href="guide">guide</a> to learn how to revision your documents with Mercurial, or just use the <a href="./quick_start">quick start</a> to get going instantly. If you already know Subversion, please see <a href="mercurial_for_svn_users">Mercurial for svn users</a>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="i-3">
				<h4>And it <a href="./testimonies">just works</a></h4>
				<p>Mercurial strives to deliver on each of its promises. Most tasks simply work on the first try and without requiring arcane knowledge. <!--(If one doesn't, that's most likely no feature but a <a href="http://selenic.com/mercurial/bugs/">bug</a>. Please <a href="http://selenic.com/mercurial/bugs/">tell us about it</a>!)
