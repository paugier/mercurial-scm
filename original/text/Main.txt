Mercurial is... 
---------------

Mercurial is a free, distributed source control management tool. It offers you the power to efficiently handle projects of any size yet provides an easy, intuitive interface. 

Every Mercurial clone is a full-fledged repository with complete history and revision tracking capabilities. It is independent of network access or a central server. Committing, branching and merging are fast and cheap. 

Mercurial is used for version control of files, much like tools such as [Git](http://git-scm.org), [Bazaar](http://bazaar-vcs.org), [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) and [CVS](http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/). It is written in Python and available on many different platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD and OpenSolaris.

How you can benefit from using Mercurial
----------------------------------------

### Power and speed
Mercurial offers you the power and speed to efficiently handle projects of any size and kind. You can use a multitude of [workflows]() and enhance its functionality with [extensions](). 

### Ease of use
Mercurials consistent and intuitive interface makes it easy to learn and understand. You can simply start with the [bare basics][] and learn incrementally or print a copy of the [hgbook]() to understand the big picture in one go. 

### Just works
Mercurial strives to deliver on each of its promises. Most tasks just work on the first try and without requiring arcane knowledge. (If one doesn't, that's most likely no feature but a [bug](http://selenic.com/mercurial/bugs/). 

[bare basics]: Quick_Start - Learn to use Mercurial in 30 seconds (or similar). 

(just works instead of webserver: webserver can far more easily be delivered by other projects, too. Just works better fits the "hg is powerful yet easy" theme -> Integrated webserver into quick start?)


Get Mercurial
-------------

If you're using Windows, download TortoiseHG for full Explorer integration. ![TortoiseHG Logo]()

GNU/Linux: Just [get it from your package manager](link to a simple guide for the different distros). 

MacOSX: Download (app). 

-> A "news" link should be alongside the version. This makes the site itneresting to returning visitors.


Mercurial Quick Start
---------------------

Clone a project and create a patch

$ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/ArneBab/hello_world
$ cd hello_world
$ (edit files)
$ hg add (new files)
$ hg commit -m 'My changes'
$ hg export > patch.diff

Create a project and commit

$ hg init (project-directory)
$ (add some files)
$ hg add
$ hg commit -m 'Initial commit'

-> [Workflows]()

(maybe instead of "Take a look"; it would be great to be able to [detect the OS](http://www.javascripter.net/faq/operatin.htm) of the visitor and show Windows users TortoiseHG while showing MacOSX and GNU/Linux users the Quick Start: )

(### Integrated webserver
With the "serve" command, Mercurial offers you an integrated webserver as the fastest way to show and share your work.)
