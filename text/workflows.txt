= Learning Mercurial in Workflows =

With Mercurial you can use a multitude of different workflows. This page shows some of them, including their use cases. 

It is intended to make it easier for you to create your own workflow. 

To write this page we gathered [real life workflows](wiki - workflows), so every more complex workflow in here has proven itself in real life usage. We begin with basic workflows and then go on to more complex examples. 

The workflows on this page are rather terse to give you a good overview. You can find a longer introduction which shows how to use these workflows in [learning Mercurial in workflows](learning_mercurial_in_workflows). 

<!--Structure: 
* For whom? -> Why?
* What do you need? -> Resources + extensions
* Single Developer workflow
* Sharing changes. -->

<!-- Plan

* Simple workflows without extensions

* Complex Workflows, including collaborative patch development and similar. 

* Smoothing workflows with extensions -> i.e. shelve before merging.
