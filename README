hg-website
==========

This is a fork of the original hg-scm.org website.  It has two goals:

* Instead of using Django to serve the site, use Blatter to generate a static version which can then be served by a normal webserver like Apache or nginx.
* Move all the content into a subrepository so volunteers can just clone that repository if they just want to edit the content.

Setup
-----

To use this version of hg-website you need to install a few things:

Blatter's prerequisites:

    easy_install jinja2
    easy_install werkzeug

My patched version of blatter (adds the ability to ignore files and add custom Jinja2 filters):

    hg clone http://bitbucket.org/sjl/blatter/
    cd blatter
    python setup.py install

The python-markdown module (for rendering the website content):

    easy_install markdown

Usage
-----

To have blatter serve the page dynamically, use:

    blatter serve

You can then visit [http://localhost:8008](http://localhost:8008) to view the site.

To render a static version of the site into the `out/` directory:

    blatter blat
