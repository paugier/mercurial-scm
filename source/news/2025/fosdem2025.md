# Presentations at FOSDEM'25

A few Mercurial contributors attended the FOSDEM conference in Brussels. FOSDEM is a
two-day event organized by volunteers to promote the widespread use of free and open
source software.

Pierre-Yves David presented
[a lightning talk on "A glimpse into a smoother version control experience"](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5989-a-glimpse-into-a-smoother-version-control-experience/).
It's a perfect short introduction for people curious to discover what is it to work with
Mercurial in 2025! The slices are

and one can even

```{rubric} Abstract
```

Distributed version control has been around for 20 years and revolutionized the way
developers collaborate with each other. One of these revolutions is the ability to edit
your commits, to simplify code review and empower the project history. However some of
these features are still viewed as arcane or dangerous by a share of the population,
sometimes for good reasons.

For the past 15 years, the Mercurial VCS has been building on a set of features, called
"changeset evolution" to make history rewriting more accessible and safer. Newer tools
like Jujutsu or Sapling have shaped their user experience around parts of these features.

In this lighting talk, we won't dive into a full explanation, but simply unroll a simple
scenario showing how simple commands you use everyday can be made more powerful,
smoothing your day-to-day workflow, giving you a glimpse into what version control can
be.
