# Learning Mercurial in Workflows

With Mercurial you can use a multitude of different workflows. This page shows some of
them, including their use cases. It is intended to make it easy for beginners of version
tracking to get going instantly and learn completely incrementally. It doesn't explain
the concepts used, because there are already many other great resources doing that.

Alternatives to this guide and further reading:

- Tutorial - a more exhaustive tutorial.
- Mercurial: The Definitive Guide - a very detailed description of Mercurial including
  behind the scenes, an indepth article on the design of Mercurial.
- Understanding Mercurial - the concepts behind Mercurial.

```{note}
This guide doesn't require any prior knowledge of version control systems (though
subversion users will likely feel at home quite quickly). Basic command line abilities
are helpful, because we'll use the command line client.
