# Learning Mercurial in Workflows

With Mercurial you can use a multitude of different workflows. This page shows some of
them, including their use cases. It is intended to make it easy for beginners of version
tracking to get going instantly and learn completely incrementally. It doesn't explain
the concepts used, because there are already many other great resources doing that.

Alternatives to this guide and further reading:

- [Tutorial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Tutorial) - a more exhaustive tutorial.
- [Mercurial: The Definitive Guide](https://book.mercurial-scm.org/) - a very detailed
  description of Mercurial including
  [behind the scenes](https://book.mercurial-scm.org/read/concepts.html), an indepth
  article on the design of Mercurial.
- [Understanding Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/UnderstandingMercurial) -
  the concepts behind Mercurial.

```{note}
This guide doesn't require any prior knowledge of version control systems (though
subversion users will likely feel at home quite quickly). Basic command line abilities
are helpful, because we'll use the command line client.
