Todo: 

Until the site can go official: 

* quick_start
* learn_mercurial (links to different resources with short descriptions)
* testimonies: "It just works (with a random quote at the beginning)
* who_uses_mercurial (Only 6 relevant projects, ideally with link to their repos and a text with their experience)
* Automatic detection of the current version for downloads. Possibly via PyPI. 

Longterm: 

* Some pages for links which currently point to the wiki but are suboptimal (for example an extension site with only the most used/useful extensions).
