---------------

Mercurial is a free, distributed source control management tool. It offers the power to handle large projects yet stays very easy to use. 

Every Mercurial clone is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, so it is independent of network access or a central server. Committing, branching and merging are fast and cheap. 

Mercurial is available on many different platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenSolaris and others.
