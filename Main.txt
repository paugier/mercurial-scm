Mercurial is... 
---------------

Mercurial is a free, distributed source control management tool. It offers you the power to efficiently handle projects of any size yet provides an easy, intuitive interface. 

Every Mercurial clone is a full-fledged repository with complete history and revision tracking capabilities. It is independent of network access or a central server. Committing, branching and merging are fast and cheap. 

Mercurial is used for version control of files, much like tools such as [Git](http://git-scm.org), [Bazaar](http://bazaar-vcs.org), [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) and [CVS](http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/). It is written in Python and available on many different platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD and OpenSolaris.

GNU/Linux: Just [get it from your package manager](link to a simple guide for the different distros). 

MacOSX: Download (app). 

-> A "news" link should be alongside the version. -


Mercurial Quick Start
---------------------

Clone a project and create a patch

$ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/ArneBab/hello_world
$ cd hello_world
$ (edit files)
$ hg add (new files)
$ hg commit -m 'My changes'
$ hg export > patch.diff

Create a project and commit

$ hg init (project-directory)
$ (add some files)
$ hg add
$ hg commit -m 'Initial commit'

-> [Workflows]()

(maybe instead of "Take a look"; it would be great to be able to detect the OS of the visitor and show Windows users TortoiseHG while showing MacOSX and GNU/Linux users the Quick Start)
